# LORE Drafting

Meteorite crashed on the planet.
The god enprisioned within spoke to them, telling them about vast cities of concrete
Some went mad, mutilating their own bodies in service of the god
Three oculus stones if raw concrete were carefully shaped to channel the energy of the sun - and finally set the god free from its meteorite shell
Before the project could be completed, rebels slaughtered the cult and put locks on the final oculus.

# Playtesting 

The map should be playable from start to end. I have mostly been testing on skill Nightmare 
Texturing, lightning and details and gameplay are still WIP and will be improved before release.

I am specifically interested in:
- Is the map balanced?
- Is it clear what to do next?
That said, all feedback is welcome!
The map should take 20-30 minutes.
Thanks for testing!

Lore and messages are still in progress, but I've added an info box at the end with info about the puzzle-like mechanics.

# TODO

Now
- Give invoker when boss spawns 
- Aggro zombies in maze. Alt target pattern
- Patrol units more
- Remove number of doors in interior somehow.
- Top arena, make enemies actually challenging before boss fight
- Dimension of agony breaks the flow completely.
- Make dimension of agony more clear that it's 30 seconds

Later
- Create an actual ladder instead of just relying on a texture
- Fix first shootable button going into wall
- Make rooms visually distinct
