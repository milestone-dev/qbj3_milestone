# LORE Drafting

Meteorite crashed on the planet.
The god enprisioned within spoke to them, telling them about vast cities of concrete
Some went mad, mutilating their own bodies in service of the god
Three oculus stones if raw concrete were carefully shaped to channel the energy of the sun - and finally set the god free from its meteorite shell
Before the project could be completed, rebels slaughtered the cult and put locks on the final oculus.

# Playtesting 

The map should be playable from start to end. I have mostly been testing on skill Nightmare 
Texturing, lightning and details and gameplay are still WIP and will be improved before release.

I am specifically interested in:
- Is the map balanced?
- Is it clear what to do next?
That said, all feedback is welcome!
The map should take 20-30 minutes.
Thanks for testing!

Lore and messages are still in progress, but I've added an info box at the end with info about the puzzle-like mechanics.

# TODO

Now
- Create an actual ladder instead of just relying on a texture
- Fix first shootable button going into wall
- Make rooms more visually distinct and use trims
- Add LORE decals to explain the story, but don't rely on them

Polish and fixes
- Add LORE with each secret, the resistance.


- It was very confusing when i randomly got told to return and protect the stone and three lone shamblers spawned
- Limit ALL TEXT TO 24 chars

------------------------

A star fell from the sky.
We constructed a temple
around the red crystal.

The god within whispers
to us in our dreams.
Dreams of vast cities,
made of concrete

The god broke off shards
of its red crystal prison.
When channeled, they release
immense destructive power.

Three oculus pillars were
constructed around the temple,
powered by the setting sun.

If aligned with the setting
sun and lit ablaze, they will
serve to crack the crystal open,
and release the god on this world.

The priests were the first
to go mad from the whispers.
Wearing the shards around
their necks, their mutilated
bodies gained power of flight.
